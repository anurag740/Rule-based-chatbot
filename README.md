# Rule-based-chatbot
The project involved creating a Telegram chatbot to answer user queries about classes, coaching, and other information from Englishfirm.com. The bot responds to FAQs on topics like IELTS, PTE, General English, course fees, schedules, and locations.


The chatbot was implemented as a Telegram bot, allowing users to interact with it through the Telegram platform. It was built using the python-telegram-bot library.
